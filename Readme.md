# Question 1
There is an equation:

![](.Readme_imgages/a4.png)

The code in `main.cpp` will find all values matches this eqation for 

    1<a<100000,
    1<b<300000,
    1<c<500000  and
    1<d<500000.

**Please optimize this code.**

If you do multiply optimization please consider to use different commit with complete explanation.

for test you code use this values:

    a = 95800 
	b = 217519 
	c = 414560 
	d = 422481

## Submit instruction
After optimizing the code, please send `main.cpp` file via email to *nikneshan***@**baregheh.com
